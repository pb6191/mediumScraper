Testimony from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot shows us exactly who we are

hen multi-hyphenate performer Childish Gambino released his visual for ‚ÄúThis Is America‚Äù in 2018, it sent shockwaves through the Twitterverse and beyond. Everyone was talking about its violence, its darkness, and its irrevocable honesty. The same can be said about the testimony of the four officers at the first hearing of the Select Committee for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Officer Harry Dunn, Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, Officer Michael Fanone, and Officer Daniel Hodges all gave harrowing accounts of what transpired for them and their fellow officers on that fateful day ‚Äî the day our government was almost overthrown while the Confederate flag breached the Capitol Building ‚Äî a sight unfathomable during the Civil War, let alone now.
Their accounts of the violence, the taunting, and the verbal and physical abuse they experienced on Jan. 6 were like watching Childish Gambino‚Äôs video come to life right before our eyes.
‚ÄúI have never been called a nigger to my face while wearing this uniform,‚Äù said Dunn, who is Black. He said it with a tone that was meshed with both grief and disbelief ‚Äî the cocktail du jour experienced by most Black people in America. Dunn‚Äôs accounting of the racial epitaphs being hurled at him ‚Äî beginning with a White woman‚Äôs taunts intended to rile up the mob of White men‚Äîconjured another awful memory for many. Hours after being honorably discharged from the United States Army after fighting for his country in World War II, Officer Issac Woodard suffered a brutal attack at the hands of South Carolina police as they pulled him off a bus and beat him, leaving him blind. What is clear is that the only uniform that many White Americans care about is the one that can‚Äôt be removed ‚Äî our Black skin.
To continue the lie of White American exceptionalism, you must erase any evidence of their involvement with violence, torture, rape, and genocide.
Because of their race and ethnicity, both Dunn and Gonell experienced the White terrorist attack on the Capitol Building differently than their fellow officers. Hodges referred to the mob as White domestic terrorists and went on to read the U.S. Code, which defines such a horrific act as those that involve ‚Äúacts dangerous to human life that are a violation of criminal laws of the United States or any State intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population.‚Äù Hodges testified about the White mob trying to convince him to come over to their side. ‚ÄúAre you our brother?‚Äù they asked. He spoke boldly about the sea of White male attackers in combat gear carrying signs of White supremacy seeking to destroy everything in their path ‚Äî including our democracy.
‚ÄúI got called a nigger a couple dozen times today protecting this building,‚Äù Dunn stated. ‚ÄúIs this America? They beat police officers with Blue Lives Matter flags. They fought us, they had Confederate flags in the U.S. Capitol.‚Äù His accounts and repeated use of one of the most heinous words in the English language once again reverberating through the sacred halls of our democracy illuminate for all that indeed this has always been America.
This is precisely why Republicans have been fighting tooth and nail to destroy any evidence of that day and gaslight the country into believing this was nothing more than a group of ‚Äúexcitable tourists‚Äù as opposed to being a White domestic terrorist mob we saw with our own eyes. This is what the beginning of tyranny looks like. Spreading fear and lies across the nation like butter on toast. If you think that the actions on Jan. 6 aren‚Äôt connected with the attacks on critical race theory, think again. To continue the lie of White American exceptionalism, you must erase any evidence of their involvement with violence, torture, rape, and genocide. You must indeed pretend that, as Rick Santorum stated, ‚Äúnothing was here before we got here.‚Äù You must refer to slavery as a ‚Äúnecessary evil.‚Äù You must refer to any attempts to tell the truth about this nation as lies or the liberal agenda. You must rewrite history as it‚Äôs unfolding.
If Jan. 6 showed the country anything, it is that we are at war. We are at war with an ideology that seeks to destroy everything that resembles truth and progress. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can act. Jan. 6 was a first attempt at bringing our democracy to its knees ‚Äî it will not be the last.
As James A. Baldwin once said: ‚ÄúPlease try to remember that what they believe as well as what they do and cause you to endure does not testify to your inferiority but to their inhumanity.‚Äù",,,,,,"5 O‚ÄôCLOCK SOMEWHERE‚Ä¶

A Florida officer getting 12 years in prison for planting drugs on suspects triggered me and probably you too.

eing pulled over by the police scares me to death. Long before Philando Castille, Sandra Bland, and Walter Scott ‚Äî all Black people who wound up dying after a traffic stop-‚Äî became national news, a cop switching lanes to drive behind me used to make my heart skip a beat. But being stopped is just the tip of the iceberg. Black folks often get framed during these stops. And as I was reading the recent story of a cop that, this past July, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for planting drugs on motorists, I was triggered. The story of this former officer made me remember a traffic stop in Virginia where I thought I too might be framed for a crime I didn‚Äôt commit.
In 2012, I was fresh out of law school and living with my cousin in Fredericksburg, Virginia. The city is about 50 miles south of northern Virginia, the ‚ÄúV‚Äù part of the DMV, and it‚Äôs also north of Richmond, a much more populated area. Fredericksburg is the kind of place a Black person drives through, not stops in.
One day, I decided I needed some new basketball sneakers. I found a Marshall‚Äôs about 10 miles from my cousin‚Äôs house, so I decided to make the trip. According to my GPS, I was making the final turn to my destination when a Fredericksburg police car pulled up behind me. At the time, I knew the blinker on my left taillight was on the fritz, and that‚Äôs precisely the kind of thing cops pull you over for.
It was the middle of the day, which I foolishly believed broad daylight would provide me some protection from being killed, but I was unfamiliar with the area, and I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances. Still, as I started to turn left, I panicked. I knew the cop was behind me, and I knew the left blinker was broken, so I decided not to turn, and I swerved suddenly back into my lane to continue driving straight.
And that‚Äôs when the lights came on. I found what I thought was a reasonably safe space and pulled over to the road‚Äôs shoulder. The officer came up to my window, mentioned my nonworking blinker, then asked for my license and registration. When he returned, he asked about my Florida registration information and questioned why I was in the city.
After explaining what I was doing, the officer made a face, and that‚Äôs when he said the words no Black person wants to hear.
‚ÄúSir, your car smells like you‚Äôve been smoking weed in here. I‚Äôm going to need you to step out of the vehicle.‚Äù
I told the officer I didn‚Äôt smoke weed and what he probably smelled was Black and Mild Summer Blend smoke. Those are fairly popular cigars. He disagreed. I exited the car and stood by the police cruiser while he called for a K-9 search unit to search my vehicle for weed and God knows what else.
Within about 15 minutes, the K-9 unit arrived, and I watched from the original officer‚Äôs cruiser with fervent anticipation. I don‚Äôt smoke weed, and I knew there weren‚Äôt any drugs in the car, but it‚Äôs not like the police aren‚Äôt capable of planting drugs on someone.
Thankfully, after about 30 or so minutes, the K-9 unit left me. The cop who pulled me over issued me a warning for the taillight and told me that changing my license would be required if I continued to stay in Virginia. I told him to have a nice day and drove back to my cousin‚Äôs house as fast as legally possible.
One might be under the impression I was unnecessarily paranoid. The cop had probable cause to pull me over but used the smell of nonexistent weed to search my car. Still, there was a genuine fear that if one of them had planted something in my car, I could have gone to jail. So, why was I paranoid?
Because it‚Äôs the same setup that recently sent ex-Florida cop Zachary Webster to prison for the next 12 years.
A jury convicted Webster for planting drugs on three different people from 2016 to 2018. Teresa Odom, Joshua Emanuel, and Steven Vann were the named victims in the case. In a bit of irony, body camera footage captured Webster carrying a baggie to Odom‚Äôs truck.
Prosecutor Tom Williams told the judge Webster should‚Äôve received more time. He called the former cop‚Äôs actions ‚Äúan egregious breach of the public‚Äôs trust.‚Äù Williams said Webster isn‚Äôt just guilty of falsifying evidence since officials used his records to convict people of crimes they didn‚Äôt commit.
‚ÄúWith that great power comes great responsibility,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúThe defendant made choices to violate that trust and committed crimes against those people he was sworn to protect.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not here to bore you with details about police reform or defunding. Most discussions about corrupt policing are fruitless because White people‚Äôs trust in cops hasn‚Äôt waned in 30 years. Too many White people believe police officers are inherently good people. Many think that corrupt police officers are an anomaly‚Äîrotten apples if you will.
So, in Webster‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs predictable for someone to read what‚Äôs written and think, ‚ÄúWell, he was a bad guy, and they caught him, so all is well.‚Äù But, as it turns out, police planting drugs isn‚Äôt exactly a rare occurrence.
In 2015, a smartphone video captured New York Police Department Officer Tininia Alexander handing Sgt. Rayna Madho a pill bottle of marijuana that Madho later tossed into Abdul Pullium‚Äôs car. One of the cops said they found weed in Pullium‚Äôs pocket before the video camera started rolling, but Pullium said that wasn‚Äôt true.
During Madho‚Äôs deposition, she said the first time she even saw the drugs was when Alexander handed them to her. But later, Madho claimed she took the drugs out of his pocket. When officials asked her about throwing the drugs in the backseat, she said she did it because she ‚Äúneeded her hands free.‚Äù The Brooklyn district attorney‚Äôs office eventually dropped the case against Pullium because they couldn‚Äôt prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.
A similar situation happened in Baltimore.
In 2017, Baltimore police officers searched a car for 30 minutes and found nothing. They turned off their body cameras. When the cameras were rolling again, the cops inexplicably found drugs in one of the car‚Äôs compartments. Video footage in a second body camera video showed Baltimore police officers planting drugs on the scene. Although seven officers were involved in the incident, internal affairs only investigated two of them.
One will have significant trouble retrieving how frequently this happens. In Sarah Laskow‚Äôs article ‚ÄúHow Often Do Cops Plant Evidence? No One Knows For Sure‚Äù for Atlas Obscura, she spoke with Philip Stinson, a former police officer and professor at Bowling Green State University. He told her government agencies don‚Äôt track these incidents.
She also cited a study where researchers called planting drugs a ‚Äúserious form of noble-cause corruption,‚Äù defined as a police officer doing the wrong thing for the ‚Äúright‚Äù reason. Laskow noted one of the roadblocks for tracking police misconduct in this context is that authorities tend to charge officers with ‚Äúofficial misconduct.‚Äù Stinson said that terminology often ‚Äúhides the true nature of the crime.‚Äù
I vividly remember the officers who pulled me over. The midday sun was boiling my skin while they searched the car. The K-9 was placing his filthy paws all over the leather seats of my BMW. I wondered whether calling my cousin should be the next move because I had no desire to go to jail in a state with Virginia‚Äôs history.
There‚Äôs no need to discuss the probability of the police framing me for a crime. Paranoia isn‚Äôt always reality-based. What I do know is that I have spent my entire life trying to make sure I never run afoul of the law.
And because I‚Äôm a Black man in these United States, I know I also have to be afraid of the law running afoul of me.",,,,,,,,,,

Tricks for going from first draft to nearly-finished when your mind just wants to be done
Sarah Stankorb
Jul 22¬∑5 min read

Over the coming weeks, writer Sarah Stankorb offers a window into her process. She says there‚Äôs no single, right way to write, but a glimpse at another writer‚Äôs tricks can offer insights into one‚Äôs own methods.
F
inishing a first draft is a brain-emptying venture. Whether by plotter‚Äôs outline or zipping through a vomit draft (‚Äúpantser‚Äù mode), the momentum of fresh words on a page can be hard to match. It‚Äôs the activity of creation. If you‚Äôre lucky, it carries a sense of being touched by the muse.
Almost always, the result, even if inspired, is a bit of a mess.
Most writers recognize a first edit may be painful, like reviewing one‚Äôs junior high school photos. Both represent a period of ample potential squeaking out in uncontrolled combinations that only rarely can be called beautiful. The human form takes time to develop, settle into itself. In the first edit, all the gawky parts lunge forth. It‚Äôs easiest then to see what isn‚Äôt working, where thoughts don‚Äôt string together, where whole words are missing. I‚Äôll give the partially formed thing a read and mark it up on paper and make the changes to my document.
A piece of writing can be improved with time and care, but usually between the first and second edit, things get stunted for me. At this point, I typically just want to be done with the damned thing.
When I fail in my edits, it‚Äôs because I succumb to my own impatience or weariness at this point, and the impulse to finish outpaces my desire to produce good work. Much as writing requires dedication, editing is its own discipline, one based in habits that constantly reveal my own natural traps. It is vulnerable, interrogating those weak points.
It‚Äôs no wonder I loathe it.
For me, the best way to trick myself into doing necessary labor is to build a to-do list. For draft #2, I find it useful to fill a page in my notebook with a list of checks, such as:
Be wary of ‚Äòof‚Äô: This is an annoying but revealing trick. I‚Äôll search the document for every instance of the word ‚Äúof‚Äù to see where I‚Äôve stretched out phrases rather than wording ideas directly (i.e., She found herself wondering what kind of person she was becoming, vs. She wondered who she‚Äôd become).
Make quotes pop: Often if I zip through and look at the quotes or dialogue, I can find spots that need clearer attribution. Or perhaps attribution is altogether unneeded, or the volley between quotes is too fast, and I should slow things down by giving one speaker a quick description (i.e., He said, ‚ÄúX.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúY.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúZ.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúABC?‚Äù ready to vomit.) Then, cut it all back. Much as I love including a source‚Äôs voice, a snippet of meaningful dialogue carries more punch than a big block quote.
Watch for the sprawl: As someone who often writes on assignment, I usually work to a set wordcount, then run right past it. To start trimming, it helps to scroll through and do a quick wordcount for each section in the piece. I jot that list of section word tallies on a post-it. Those numbers in a line show the rhythm of the ideas I‚Äôve strung together. The sections don‚Äôt all need to be equivalent. (There can be good reasons to have punchy, short sections here and there.) But when I find one section sprawling out at twice or even three times the average length of the others, that‚Äôs a sure sign there‚Äôs an idea that either needs to be split into two sections or carefully preened away.
Cool the em dashes: Good god, I love an em dash. A quick scan for them usually shows multiple lines mashed together with one hand-holding em dash after another ‚Äî me, interrupting myself, repeatedly, with rude disregard. I will always keep a few but untangling the thickest nests of em dashes usually forces me to pry loose the smaller, component, but clearer sentences.
I‚Äôll count completing a list like this and another read-through as the second draft. By now I have come to resent the thing I love. If at all possible, it‚Äôs wise to get at least a day away for distance, longer for lengthier pieces. For the third draft, I make the copy itself look different. I‚Äôll turn the document to landscape layout, put it into columns, choose a new and odd font. Comic Sans for a tragedy? Sure. Make that bright, pink Comic Sans.
This makes my darlings and my word wrecks all look equally absurd. Killable.
The battle of later editing rounds, for me, is trying not to default to what I think I already wrote ‚Äî the articulate dream draft I‚Äôd pictured in my mind ‚Äî and face the choppy reality before me.
By draft three though, some of the lines have started to smooth, and whatever themes reside within that I hadn‚Äôt noticed (or even intended) start to make themselves known. I can see an impression of the story I meant to write and where it needs nurturing to solidify. Sometimes I‚Äôll read this silly-looking draft and simply highlight the clunker phrases so I can come back to fill in improvements later.
Last, I use the read aloud function to hear the piece and catch any haltering moments.
Sadly, even after all this, the work isn‚Äôt done, but I‚Äôve reached my capacity to see where it needs more help by myself. Now, I‚Äôm likely up against deadline. It‚Äôs an unexplored rule of the physical universe that my ability to self-edit is directly correlated to deadline. Time‚Äôs up, my brain turns off. There‚Äôs nothing more I can do, and I don‚Äôt want to anyway.
This is precisely why writers will loyally follow good editors anywhere. There‚Äôs little better than a wise reader unafraid to tell you how to do better, spare you working out draft number four on your own.",,,,,,"WRITE HERE
